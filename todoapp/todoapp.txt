Sameer and me had a phone chat now and as part of the further process I would like him to
create a simple Webservice with the following problem statement.

A TODO Restful service with the ability to 
Get All Todos
Create a Todo
Get a Todo by id
Update a Todo
Delete a Todo

The Todo entity has the following fields:
1> ID
2> Title(Name)
3> Status(is done)
4> Due Date(time at which this is due)

This can be a simple HTTP service created using the packages inside Golang's standard library(https://golang.org/pkg/)
The datastore can be an in-memory data structure
This assignment can be submitted via a public github.com Id.

Please try to submit this assignment by Thursday.
Also I dont have Sameer's co-ordinates. Kindly forward it to him.
